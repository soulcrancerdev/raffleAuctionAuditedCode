## Code structure
* `programs/justies/`: the Solana program codes;
    * `lib.rs`: the index to all the instructions;
  * `common/`: the common code utilities;
  * `admin/`: all the admin-related states & instructions;
  * `auction/`: all the auction-related states & instructions;
  * `raffle/`: all the raffle-related states & instructions;
* `libraries`: the Typescript libraries for Justies program client and dev environment helpers;
* `tests`: all the tests;
* `migrations`: all the scripts related to deploy;

## Run test

All the use cases are covered by test cases.  The test suite is fully self-contained. It is implemented as integration
tests with all dependent programs deployed and all test token data created in the local validator brought up by Anchor.

The tests are located at the `tests` subdir. To run them:

* Make sure you have installed the Rust & Solana & Anchor developing kits by following this
  [instruction](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation);
* Run `yarn` to install the node dependencies.
* Run `yarn test` to run all the tests.
